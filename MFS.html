  <h2> Madison Oyster Bar </h2>
  <p class="Location-Paragraph">The dining experience starts with tradition that has been handed down from generation to generation by the Simeri Family.  You are immediately drawn in by their beautiful wood bar and the warm colors of the decor and lighting. Multiple big screen TVs, darts & pool tables all combine to make a very chill and comfortable, yet classic atmosphere. Madison Oyster Bar has a feel differing from all other sports or college bars in the area, yet lacks pretension, making it a perfect place to meet for a drink after work, gather up during a football game, or anything in between.</p>
